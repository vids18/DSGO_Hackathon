# DSGO Hackathon
DSGO is the acronym for DataScienceGO conference that is held twice a year. This conference focuses on learning from experts, peers, mentors, and colleagues. People from around the globe and with all level of expertise are participating in this event with an awesome experience for everyone. DSGO had organized a hackathon for beginners to work in a group that could help the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to analyze the air quality in protected ecosystems that are sensitive to pollution.


This repository is a forked repositiry from a team member of mine that encompases all the data files and the output files of the work that was performed in the hackathon. The deliverable are mentioned below as:

- Powerpoint presentation that summarizes the entire work
- A python script for the EDA ( used Jupyter Notebook )
- Another python script that has a model created for predicting the amount of NO3 in air at different Californian sites using Linear Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Model evaluation is based on the least RMSE
- Lastly a csv file is attached that predicts the total amount of NO3 at California sites.
